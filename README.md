# Guess My Number

Study project on [_"The Complete JavaScript Course 2022"_](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by [_Jonas Schmedtmann_](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).

## Descriprion

A simple game that generates a random number from 1 to 20 and guides the user to guess it. The trick is to do it in a fewer moves.

## How it was made

After learning the fundamentals of JavaScript and some small exercises, this project became _the first practical task in the course_. _HTML_ and _CSS_ code was written by the teacher. I wrote _JavaScript_ code along with video explanations.
